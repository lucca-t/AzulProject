Azul is a tile-placement game where players take turns drafting tiles from a central market to place on their boards, scoring points based on how they've arranged them. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completed sets, while unused tiles reduce your score.

This project brings Azul to your computer, with a clickable, interactive board and the same rules as the physical version.

## ðŸŽ® Features
